# AlzheimerDisease
### What it does
The Xgboost trained model utilises a set of input parameters from the user which includes the Brain MRI scan information and the personal background information to predict the CDR value for early detection from Brain MRI.

### How it's built
It is built through a processed stage involving-
1. Data preprocessing
2. Training Linear Model and analysing the performance, p-values, fitting plots, residuals, R-square values, etc.
3. Training Xgboost Model
4. Training Neural Network Model
5. Used Plumber API to connect model from R studio to the Website
6. Built the front end and configured the API
